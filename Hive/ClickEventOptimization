Click Event:
----------

click-stream event table:

>CREATE TABLE clicks (
timestamp date, sessionID string, url string, source_ip string
) STORED as ORC tblproperties (“orc.compress” = “SNAPPY”);

Each record represents a click event, and we would like to find the latest URL for each sessionID.

>SELECT clicks.* FROM clicks inner join
(select sessionID, max(timestamp) as max_ts from clicks
group by sessionID) latest
ON clicks.sessionID = latest.sessionID and
clicks.timestamp = latest.max_ts;

In the above query, we build a sub-query to collect the timestamp of the latest event in each session, and then use an inner join to filter out the rest.

While the query is a reasonable solution—from a functional point of view—it turns out there’s a better way to re-write this query as follows:

>SELECT * FROM
(SELECT *, RANK() over (partition by sessionID,order by timestamp desc) as rank FROM clicks) ranked_clicks
WHERE ranked_clicks.rank=1;

Here we use Hive’s OLAP functionality (OVER and RANK) to achieve the same thing, but without a Join.
